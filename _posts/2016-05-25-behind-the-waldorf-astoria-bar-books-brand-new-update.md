# On-Line Systems: Before the Franchises
![Crossfire and Cannonball Blitz](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/959a3855-2782-479d-8ae9-1cb56aa36009.jpg)

Crossfire (1981), by Jay Sullivan, is a faithful recreation of the arcade game TARG (1980). Jay Sullivan worked at Informatics with Ken Williams before Ken started On-Line Systems. Ken co-founded a mail-order software business, Calsoft, with Jay -- it was the first of its kind. Calsoft was run by Sullivan in Agoura, California, and On-Line Systems helped with order fulfillment (phone operators) and needed materials such as catalogs and advertising.

Cannonball Blitz (1982), by Olaf Lubeck, is a decent and slightly abstracted version of Donkey Kong.

The original source material, "Old Waldorf Bar Days" (1931), also by Crockett, was penned during Prohibition but the author rewrote it as we know it in 1933 when Prohibition ended.</p></article>
